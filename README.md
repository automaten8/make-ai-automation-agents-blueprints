Make AI Automation Agents & Blueprints
This repository contains modular AI-first automation agents and workflow blueprints built in Make. Each folder includes a specific automation use case — ranging from inbound lead handling to outbound prospecting and calendar scheduling.

🧠 What’s Inside
✅ Autonomous agents that can qualify leads, book meetings, and respond to emails

🔁 Reusable sub-scenarios like get_available_time_slots and book_meeting

🧩 Conditional logic + OpenAI GPT-4 for dynamic and personalized outputs

🔗 Integrations with Gmail, Google Calendar, Sheets, Airtable, and external APIs via HTTP
